# 🔫 Gun Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes firearm background check data in the U.S., focusing on handgun sales trends and transaction types using Python and pandas.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset name: `gun_data.csv` (from Udacity)
- Shape: 12,485 rows × 27 columns
- Contains monthly firearm background check data by U.S. state

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Explore trends in handgun sales by state
- Identify the most frequent types of firearm transactions
- Clean and preprocess data for meaningful analysis
- Visualize and summarize key findings

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps
- Dropped columns with >90% missing values
- Generated histograms for all numeric features
- Created bar charts to compare handgun sales across states
- Calculated correlations after excluding non-numeric columns

## ✅ Findings
- Texas, California, and Florida have the highest handgun sales
- Most numeric features are right-skewed (long tail)
- Some transaction types were extremely rare and excluded from analysis

## 📂 Files Included
- `gun_data.ipynb`: Full analysis notebook
- `gun-data.xlsx`: Raw dataset
- `README.md`: Project overview
